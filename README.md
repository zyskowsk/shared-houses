Shared Houses
=============

### Details
Shared houses is a web app to help simplify sharing expenses with housemates.
A house can create an account and then each hosemate creates their own account
inside the house.  Users can add purchases as well as add or remove items
to the To Buy list.  At the end of the month, the house admistrator can create a 
new statement, which organizes all of the months payments and tells the house 
who owes who what.

### Technology
To build this app I used Ruby on Rails, as well as Devise for authentication and
Twitter Bootstrap, and JQuery for styling and UI.

Deployed using Heroku at: [www.sharedhous.es](http://www.sharedhous.es)
